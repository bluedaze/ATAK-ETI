            <div style="text-align: left;">Sean Preston Pedigo is a 34-year-old celebrity chef who enjoys reading, yoga and cycling. 
                He is smart and creative, but can also be very lazy and a bit stingy. He is Italian. He started studying food science at college but never finished the course. 
                He is obsessed with tank tops. Physically, Sean is slightly overweight but otherwise in good shape. He is tall with dark chocolate skin, grey hair and green eyes. 
                He grew up in a working class neighbourhood. He was raised by his father, his mother having left when he was young. He is currently single. 
                His most recent romance was with a kitchen assistant called Francesca Harris Coleman, who was 8 years older than him. 
                They broke up because Francesca felt threatened by Sean's intelligence. Sean has one child with ex-girlfriend Francesca: Herman aged 8. 
                Sean's best friend is a celebrity chef called Bruno Matthews. They get on well most of the time. He also hangs around with Kye Mclaughlin and Donna Lee. 
                They enjoy watching television together
